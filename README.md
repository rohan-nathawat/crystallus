# Crystallus
A github repository that contains the files for my 2024 submisson to TSA's video game design event, Crystallus. Crystallus is a fantasy-adventure platforming game where you play as an unknown hero tasked with retrieving a crystal to save his world. Along the way, he fights various monsters and talks with the locals of the areas he visits.
